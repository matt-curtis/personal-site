tldr: "Have you ever used Figma or Sketch? Better yet, have you ever moved a rectangle? You owe me 5 bajillion dollars. Kidding! But you can send it to me anyway, in case you want to bless someone today. I have 8 billion siblings — because after all, together, we are all God's Children — and it is very expensive to feed them."

In its early days, I used to be fairly involved in the [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) plugin development community. I would use Sketch pretty frequently to design websites and apps, and it was super convenient to be able to just... write a plugin to make whatever the current design task I was working on easier.

Back then, Sketch didn't have autolayout (the ability to automatically position and size layers) like it does now. You had to manually position and resize rectangles like some kind of caveman. _Meanwhile,_ in the Land of Code, systems for laying out elements and enforcing consistent sizing and spacing were super common, but — at the time — missing from most design tools. So it came pretty naturally to me to want the same sort of system and tools when designing. (Fun fact: internally, Fluid _literally_ reused [Apple's Auto Layout framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html) to calculate where to place and how to size design layers, because I am ~~lazy~~ _efficient._)

Turns out, [Cat Noone](https://x.com/imcatnoone) (another one of my Favorite People) had the same idea. Cat tweeted about a similar concept; I replied "bet?" and the rest is history. We launched Fluid on Product Hunt to 700+ upvotes and were ranked #2 of all product launches that day, with 2.4k stars on Github. Shortly thereafter Obama gave us the Nobel prize. I'm lying about that last part — that happened in my dreams — but the rest is true.

These days, suspiciously, both Sketch and [Figma](https://figma.com) have autolayout-like features baked-in. Now, I'm not saying we gave them the idea, but I'm also not _not_ saying that, you know?

But I am saying, like, maybe, just _maybe_, Cat and I deserve royalties.
