In its early days, I used to be fairly involved in the Sketch plugin development community. I would use Sketch pretty frequently to design websites and apps, and it was super convenient to be able to just... write a plugin to make whatever the current design task I was working on easier.

Back then, Sketch didn't have autolayout like it does now. You had to manually position and resize rectangles like some kind of caveman. In the Land of Code, systems for laying out elements and enforcing consistent sizing and spacing were super common, but — at the time — missing from most design tools. So it came pretty naturally to me to want the same sort of system and tools when designing. (Fun fact: internally, Fluid _literally_ used Apple's autolayout framework to calculate where to place and how to size design layers, because I am ~~lazy~~ _effective._)

Turns out, Cat Noone had the same idea. Cat tweeted about a similar concept; I replied "bet?" and the rest is history. We launched Fluid on Product Hunt to 700+ upvotes and were ranked #2 of all product launches that day, with 2.4k stars on Github. Not bad.

These days, suspiciously, both Sketch and Figma have autolayout-like features baked-in. Now, I'm not saying we gave them the idea, but I'm also not _not_ saying that, you know?

But am saying, like, maybe, just maybe, Cat and I deserve royalties.
