tldr: "Once a week a buddy and I would trek for many, many long miles and gather around The Orb. We'd ask \"Oh Orb, what's being Slept on?\" and The Orb would reply. The Orb would supply. And with what the Orb supplied, we'd supply you."

I built UNSLEPT with a buddy of mine, [Tregg](https://tre.gg/). (Who, by the way, happens to be one of my favorite people, a great dad, product designer and person in general.)

While "What if there was a book club, except instead of books... it was metalcore?" sounds like the sort of question someone asks in a sketchy college dorm room after smoking ungodly amounts of weed, it _did_ form the premise of UNSLEPT. (Yeah we spelled that in _all caps_, baby. It was edgier that way. Also, sorry, I can't promise no weed was involved.)

Sign up, give us your phone number, and once a week we'd send you a new album to listen to. Maybe you love it. Maybe you hate it. Maybe you want our address so you can firebomb us: too bad! Our HQ was in the most secure and impenetrable place on earth: the bunker where they keep the Epstein files. Instead, listen, then take whatever emotions the music filled you with out on your fellow listeners in Discord.

UNSLEPT is currently on haitus... but who knows? Maybe it'll be back one day, reborn as a music-based AI-powered dating app. Just kidding. We're not that high.

Yet.
