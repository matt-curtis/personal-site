Zemel is an outgrowth of my work on Hyphen. Hyphen needed to be able to parse lots of XML fast, which is exactly what Zemel does. Zemel features a number of stuff that cuts down on the time and memory necessary to parse lots of XML. Unlike traditional XML parsing libraries, Zemel lets you do things like quit parsing early, parse in chunks, and extract information from elements as soon as they are individually parsed (instead of after the entire document has been parsed.)
