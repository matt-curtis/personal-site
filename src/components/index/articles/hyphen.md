Growing up I would read a lot. (This is also an area where I was probably somewhat insufficiently supervised. Not that I was reading anything, like, particularly indecent or something. Well. Actually, there was that time I tried to read _Flowers for Algernon_ and later _Twilight_, both before my precious little mind, or body, was ready.)

Like all gateway drugs do, it started with libraries. My mom would take my sisters and I to the local library and let us run wild (bless you, mom). _Eventually_ my parents relaxed this habit and weren't always available to take us, and I started wanting to read things without having to go through the living, breathing communist censor that was my parents.

This meant my reading habit went digital. I'd just gotten an iPod Touch (which I won in an online giveaway, by the way. This was at a time when God was Real, Nigerian princes actually _did_ want to give you $50k, hot singles were not just in your area, ma'am, but in your _backyard_, and there was enough money flowing through the internet to fund companies that gave things away for free) and did all of my reading on it.

Steve Bezos killed reading for me. In 2009, Amazon purchased _Stanza_, the app I used to do all of my reading. A few years later, after letting Stanza die a slow, painful death of insufficient maintenance, Amazon finally took Stanza behind the App Store and put it out of its misery.

Goddamit, Steve.

Luckily, I had been programming a fair bit by that point. I'd never built or designed anything as complex as full-scale mobile app... but, because I was young and delusional (versus now, with me being older and yet more delusional), I thought: why shouldn't I try to just... replace it?

And so I taught myself Objective-C, learned what Xcode was (and that you shouldn't spell it XCode, or else strangers on the internet would yell at you. strangers on the internet yell a _lot_, it would turn out), copywriting, mobile design, developed opinions about tabs and spaces, and most importantly, a crippling sense of social anxiety. All of the things a young virgin needs for a successful start in life.

In 2015, after worrying my parents with how much time I was spending on my laptop, I released Hyphen. Hyphen ended up getting a _decent_ amount of buzz and positive reviews in several publications. And while it _did_ earn me a non-zero amount of money, it also taught me something even more important: that if you make something people like, sometimes they'll say nice things. Most of the time they won't say anything. But if, god forbid, you write a bug, or forget that _one_ feature someone needs? People you didn't know existed will make themselves _known_, and they will not say nice things about it. And that you'll develop a weird sort of relationship to this dynamic... you'll start to actually _like_ thinking about features, and designing stuff to solve peoples' problems, even if they're not grateful for it, because sometimes they will be? Maybe? And this is definitely healthy, right?

Anyway I learned nothing from that experience and kept doing it.

(Hyphen, for the record, is no longer actively maintained. But who knows... maybe that'll change, some day :))
