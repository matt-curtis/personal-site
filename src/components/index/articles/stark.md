tldr: 'People make software. Software need be usable by many kind of people, or lawyer find and kill you. Stark help you stay alive! I help Stark do that. I do that many way. Make many things at Stark! Make big computer engine, tell you when your software not usable and you might get killed. Use things like web tech, SwiftUI, and brain.'

Alright, so: every day, billions of people across the world use their phones and computers to work, play, and connect with each other. If you're (presently) typically-abled, it's very easy to assume everyone has the same experience with technology you do. But that's an illusion; over one billion people (16% of the the world pop.!) live with some form of disability, and those disabilities affect whether or not someone has the same access to technology as you do.

Plus, it's _really_ expensive if you donâ€™t make your software accessible and then, like, get sued.

At Stark, it was my job to help answer this question we'd given ourselves: how do we ensure that the people who make software that is used every day by billions, make software that is as usable as possible, for everyone?

In the pursuit of the answer, I did stuff like:

- build our core accessibility engine that quickly finds and suggests solutions to issues in design files. (This engine powers 1000s of accessibility audits a day at companies like NASA, Google, and Microsoft. Did I say those names already?)

- co-lead the development of Stark for Mac. Stark for Mac was built with 100% free-range SwiftUI at a time when there were few other apps doing that, which, as always, means that if you found a bug, or tried to do something slightly unusual? Ha. God bless your soul.\

Stark for Mac's goal to make it easy for designers to find accessibility issues in their designs before they launched them. Eventually it was ported entirely to the web (which I also helped build.)

- contribute to design and development across a bunch of product touchpoints: web, desktop, plugins... you name it, I put my lil' fingers in it.
