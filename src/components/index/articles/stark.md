tldr: 'People make software. Software need be usable by many kind of people, or lawyer find and kill you. Stark help you stay alive! Matt help Stark do that. Matt do that many way. Make many things at Stark! Make big computer engine, tell you when your software not usable and you might get killed. Use things like web tech, SwiftUI, and sometimes brain.'

OK, so: every day, billions of people all over the world use their phones and computers to work, play, and connect with each other. If you're (presently) typically-abled, it's very easy to assume everyone has the same experience with technology you do. But that's an illusion; over one billion people (16% of the the world pop.!) live with some form of disability, and those disabilities affect whether or not someone has the same access to technology as you do.

Plus, it's _really_ expensive if you don’t make your software accessible and then, like, get sued.

At Stark, it was my job to help answer this question we'd given ourselves — how do we ensure the people making software used every day by billions, make software that is usable for _everyone_?

In the pursuit of the answer, I did stuff like:

- contribute to design and development across a bunch of product touchpoints: web, desktop, plugins... you name it, I put my lil' fingers in it

- build our core accessibility engine that quickly finds and suggests solutions to issues in design files. (This engine powered 1000s of accessibility audits a day at companies like NASA, Google, and Microsoft. Did I say those names already?)

- co-lead the development of one of Stark for Mac. Stark for Mac was built with 100% free-range SwiftUI at a time when there were few other apps doing that, which meant that if you found a bug, or tried to do something slightly unusual you were exactly what we'll all be when we die: alone.\

That got darker than I meant for it to be, but you get the idea.\

Stark for Mac's goal was to make it easy for designers to find accessibility issues in their designs before they launched them. Eventually we realized that experience needed to also be available on the web, which is where we eventually ported it (and I also helped build.)
